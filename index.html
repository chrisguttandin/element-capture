      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        Pre-existing mechanisms such as {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} allow Web applications to
        initiate screen-capture. If the user chooses to share a tab, the capturing application
        has a video {{MediaStreamTrack}}. Mechanisms such as [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]]
        allow this track to be mutated - performing some operation on the captured frames. (In the
        case of [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]], this mutation consists of cropping.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This document introduces a new mutation mechanism which we name "restriction". After a Web
        application "restricts" a video track to a given target-element, frames produced on that
        video track only consist information from the target-element and (and its descendants).
        Phrased differently, the track becomes a capture of the DOM sub-tree rooted at the
        target-element.

        <h3>Generic Use-Case</h3>
        <p>
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] allows applications to crop captures. Assume some
          element <code>TARGET</code> is the crop-target. What if other elements, which are not
          DOM-descendants of <code>TARGET</code>, draw in front of <code>TARGET</code>? Using
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]], these other elements would also get captured,
          which is not always desirable. A mechanism is sought that would allow cropping to
          <code>TARGET</code>'s bounding box, while also excluding from capture any of the content
          that is not a DOM-descendant.

      <section id="practical-use-case-1">
        <h3>Practical Use-Case #1: Recording part of an app</h3>
        <p>
          Consider an "editor" Web application (text-editor, image-editor, slides-editor or
          video-editor). Such applications often include a main content area, surrounded by various
          toolbars, drop-down menus and widgets which allow the local user to edit the content in
          the main content area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes a Web application wishes to record only the main content area, and then either
          transmit it "live" to remote participants, or record it to disk. Such an application would
          not necessarily wish to expend storage, bandwidth, or remote participants' screen
          real-estate on anything outside of the main content area.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mechanism such as [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] helps with cropping to the
          bounding box of the target-element, but what happens when drop-down lists temporarily draw
          over it?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="practical-use-case-2">
        <h3>Practical Use-Case #2: Collaborative tools during video-conferencing</h3>
        <p>
          Video-conferencing applications often arrange themselves using "tiles" - each remote
          participant's video is presented in a tile. Assume that a collaborative Web application,
          like a text editor or an image-editing application, is loaded in another iframe, and that
          this iframe is also presented as a tile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some remote participants would similarly load the same tool in a dedicated tile. But what
          if some users don't have the necessary permissions to load that tool? Or if they are
          joining from a platform that does not support the tool?
        </p>
        <p>
          The video conferencing solution may then choose to have one of the participants who have
          loaded the tool successfully screen-share that tool's tile to the users who cannot load
          the tool, allowing them to at least view it, although not interact with it. This can be
          done using self-capture through {{MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia()}} and
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]].
        </p>
        <p>
          But such a solution introduces some problems. What happens if other elements ever draw on
          top of the tool tile, either briefly or permanently? Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Private messages sent inside of the video-conferencing application.</li>
          <li>Requests by new users to join.</li>
          <li>Other tiles during tile-layout changes.</li>
          <li>Drop-down lists from other elements of the video-conferencing application.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Solution Overview</h2>
      <p>The Element Capture mechanism comprises two parts:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          [=CropTarget production=]: A mechanism for <dfn>tagging</dfn> an {{Element}} as a
          potential target for the [=restriction mechanism=].
        </li>
        <li>
          [=Restriction mechanism=]: A mechanism for instructing the user agent to start restricting
          a video track to the bounding box of a previously [=tagging|tagged=] {{Element}}, or to
          stop such restriction and revert a track to its [=unrestricted=] state.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We define two <dfn>restriction-states</dfn>. <dfn>restricted</dfn> and
        <dfn>unrestricted</dfn>. Video tracks are always in one state or the other. Tracks start out
        [=unrestricted=], and may turn to [=restricted=] when
        {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo()}} is successfully called.

        <p>
          [[mediacapture-region|Region Capture]] introduced the {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack}}
          interface. We extend it with a new method, {{BrowserCaptureMediaStreamTrack/restrictTo}}.
        </p>
        <pre class="idl">

              Calls to this method instruct the user agent to start/stop restrict a video track.
